## This is going to be a general information referral file I am making for the group.
    
    - It will include general information on each language we are using to help your learning curve as well as other associated information to our project.

## ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### There is a Template file for each of the primary languages we will be using primarily as well.

#### GIT

    - The following will be simple git commands to use to keep version control and collaboration smooth

    - "git pull origin main" <- This is pulling the code from the connected repo (Repository -> Just means directory so the file structure essentially) and the branch 'main'.
        - Good practice to pull the repo code before you code anything so you can avoid merge conflicts later on...

    - "git add (filename)" <- Adds a specific file to a Commit (More on Commits below...)
    - "git add ." <- Adds all changed files to a Commit (I personally always use this over adding individual files)

    - "git commit -m "Title of the commit of your choosing" <- This wraps all the changed file into a thing called a commit (Its kind of just a name to the changes in the code that your adding or "commiting' to the repo...)

    - "git push origin main <- This is pushing the code from your local version to the connected repo and the branch 'main'.

    - so lets say you just made a SQL table and did some edits on one of our pages (php) you would push it to the connected repository with :

    1st: "git add ."
    2nd: "git commit -m "Worked on UserDatabase Table and Fixed a product description"
    3rd: "git push origin main"

        - And this would push all the changes you made into the github repo and then the rest of us could use git pull and get all the code. 

###### SQL 
    
    - filepath -> "/Databases/Template.sql"

###### PHP

    - filepath -> "/FrontEnd/Template.php"

###### CSS

    - filepath -> "/Styling/Template.css"

###### Misc

    - We probably won't end up using much JS (JavaScript) so I didn't include a Template file for it. As well as html we most likely will not be outwardly making html files as they are static... For html syntax/code refer to the PHP Template as it has plenty of html code and structure in it.
